# Pixcel Machine Lab

Learning and experimenting with AI + Computer Vision.

## Structure
- `src/` → Python scripts (Haar, ResNet, YOLO)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step explanations (maybe)
- `data/` → sample images & videos
- `requirements.txt` → dependencies

## Goals
- E.g. Compare traditional (Haar Cascades) and modern (CNN, YOLOv8) face detection
- Provide reproducible experiments for media informatics students
- Serve as a living lab for computer vision exploration
